# Chainlink-Connected Registry

This contract serves as an example for how to create an on-chain registry which is validated by the Chainlink network. For example, an individual wishing to register would provide the `register` method with an ID, whether that's a Job ID or a Service Agreement ID, and some piece of data that the Chainlink network can use. That piece of data will be stored in the `"result"` key, and can be sent through the HttpPost core adapter or to an external adapter for some endpoint. That API can decide whether the given query was valid or not and return a result, which would then be passed back to the Registry contract's `fulfill` method. The `fulfill` method will emit a log, which can be monitored off-chain, if the addition to the registry was successful.
